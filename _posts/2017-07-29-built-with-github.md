  Greetings, Internet! Our new company beta site is proudly made in the U.S.A. using Jekyll and Github Pages.

# Github is super geeky.

I don't pretend to be a geek. I know some HTML but certainly don't consider myself someone who "codes" or programs computers. Since college I've done hundreds of tutorials in the space.  No where did I fail harder than Github. 

After nearly two years of failing to configure a simple, monochromatic site + blog in Github, I'd read every on-site tutorial on Jekyll & Pages several times, as well as watched dozens of meticulous video tutorials on YouTube. 

That's why the more I hang around here, the more I'm humbled when I see all of the amazing things built in Github. This particular site for the media consultancy I co-founded last year never quite came together through my own acumen.

Tbh, after another evening wasted last week on the spectacle of inexplicable pull-edit fails, I was at my wit's end. I still cannot for the life of me connect with dots between a new Github repository into a simple, functional, public website using Jekyll, like this one.

Getting this site live meant trusting an acquaintance with a computer science background with my login information and hoping for the best. An hour later, I received a message that this site had been configured to successfully exist a simple, functional, public website built and maintained in a Github repository. 

At long last, I have a site in Github that I can work with ... for me, the first of it's kind but certainly not the last.
